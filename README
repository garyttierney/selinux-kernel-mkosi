selinux-kernel-mkosi
--------------------

mkosi configuration files for building an selinux-testsuite root filesystem.
The aim here is to make testing kernel changes against the test suite as fast
as possible.


Building an image
--------------------

An image can be built by simply running "sudo mkosi", when that completes the
image will be put into permissive mode and and relabel on next boot (note: this
seems to be a bug, systemd wants to relabelto on an unconfined users files
before auto-relabel happens).  The output will be a single GPT disk image file
with one partition (the rootfs).

Running the image
--------------------

There's many ways to run the image produced, however, we want to test kernel
changes, so we're interested in booting this image in qemu.  The following should
suffice for booting a new image with a custom kernel:

qemu-kvm -kernel kernel/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
         -drive format=raw,file=image.raw -serial stdio \
         -append "root=/dev/sda1 rw rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0" -m 256M
